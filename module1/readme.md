# Week 1: Variables

## 0 - Hello world 
Make a program that prints "Hello world!".

Put your program in hello.py

This is to get used to the codegrade system and typing/running python programs.

## 1 - VAT
Write a program that takes the price of an article including VAT and prints
the price of the article without VAT. The VAT is currently 21.00%.

Example: 
```
Enter the price of an article including VAT: 121
This article will cost 100.00 euro without 21.00% VAT.
```
Make sure to print the price and VAT percentage using 2 decimals.

## 2 - Chatty
Program a highly advanced chatbot, using variables!

An example run:
```
What is your name? John
What is the name of your pet? Freckles
What sound does Freckles make? Miauw
----
Hi John!

A message from Freckles: Miauw Miauw

Bye John!
```
## 3 - Plumber
The employees at plumbery ‘The Maverick Monkey’ are notoriously bad mathematicians. Therefore the boss has decided to use a computer program to calculate the cost of a repair. The cost of a repair can be calculated in the following way: the hourly wages multiplied by the number of billable hours plus the call-
out cost. The number of billable hours is the number of hours worked rounded up to the nearest integer. Plumbing laws fix the call-out cost at €16,00.

Example:
```
Enter the hourly wages: 31.50
Enter the number of hours worked: 4.5
The total cost of this repair is: 173.50 euro
```

## 4 - Othello 1
Othello, is a 2-player deterministic (no use of dice), perfect information (no information only known to one of the players) board game, similar to chess or go.

The goal of this assignment is to give some information about the outcome once an Othello game has finished. This information is obtained by two measurements:

- The percentage of black pieces of all the pieces on the board.
- The percentage of the board that is covered in black pieces.
The Othello board measures eight squares by eight squares, making the total number of squares sixty-four.

Write a program that takes the number of white pieces followed by the number of black pieces as input. Print the two percentages as output.

Example:
```
Enter the number of white pieces on the board: 34
Enter the number of black pieces on the board: 23
The percentage of black pieces on the board is: 35.94%
The percentage of black pieces of all the pieces on the board is: 40.35%
```
