# Week 3 - Functions

## 1 - Nuclear Power Plant 
The nuclear powerplant at Threeyedfish will automatically run a program to print a warning message when the reactor core becomes unstable. The warning message reads:
```
NUCLEAR CORE UNSTABLE!!! 
Quarantine is in effect. 
Surrounding hamlets will be evacuated. 
Anti-radiationsuits and iodine pills are mandatory.
```

Since the message contains crucial information, it should be printed three times. To do this, write a function that prints this message. This function has to be used three times.
